<h1 style="color:white"><b>Explaining the choices of Dying Light <image height="20" width="10" src="https://i.imgur.com/dEa9WIs.png"></image>. </h1>
<hr>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> I will be explaining every single major story choice in Dying Light 2 from what i know. Starting off:</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> The raid: Our first major story choice is in this mission. This is a choice that appears when going into the tango motel to meet Sophie and the following choices go as: Go to aitor / Go and meet sophie </h2>
<br>
<image height="500" with="500" src="https://attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dying-Light-2-Aitor-or-Sophie.jpg"></image>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> The choices are self explanatory but im still gonna explain. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If we went to meet sophie, we would  barge straight into the Tango Motel. You’ll find that it is littered with dead Peacekeepers who were trapped by the Bazaar Survivors. After searching the motel for Sophie, you’ll reach the roof and find a radio belonging to a dead Peacekeeper with Aitor trying to get through. As you respond to Aitor, you’ll get discovered by Barney, leading to him accusing you of being a traitor.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> Barney will set some Survivor goons on you, so you’ll have to fight them. When you try to leave the roof after defeating the goons, you’ll be greeted to a boss fight with Sophie’s bodyguard, Hermann, who will cause the roof to collapse. After defeating him, Hakon will save you with a ladder back to the roof and will suggest that Barney has something to hide and that he needs to be found.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white ">After finding a gated saferoom within the motel, you’ll see Barney and Sophie wielding a crossbow on the other side of the gate. She’ll tell you that the people of the Bazaar are desperate and need that water tower to survive, leading you to your next choice. Will you say that you can help each other or will you test Sophie and say “try me”?</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Deciding that you think you and Sophie can help each other will lead to yet another choice to simply confirm exactly how you want to proceed. You’ll be asked if you definitely want to help Sophie and can respond either yes or no. Choosing “yes” will side you with the Bazaar Survivors and Sophie for now, and she’ll give you the quest to take back the Water Tower from Jack and Joe.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you’re set on trying to help with Aitor’s investigation, picking the “try me!” option during this confrontation will cause you to question Sophie and Barney about who killed Commander Lucas. While you don’t really learn anything new, Sophie says that you’re more use to her alive than dead, for now, and leaves the motel with Barney. With nothing else to go on with the Bazaar Survivors, you’re forced to head back to Aitor to update him on the investigation and he’ll give you the Water Tower quest. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Below is a full video of choosing to  meet Sophie.</h2>

<br>
<h1 style="color:white">Now what would happen if we went to <text style="color:rgb(66, 141, 211)">Aitor? </text></h1>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you follow Hakon’s advice and decide to report what you’ve done so far, you’ll be directed to report back to Aitor at the Peacekeeper station HQ. He’ll tell you that the Peacekeepers plan on taking control of Jack and Joe’s water tower to tip the scales in their favor for their investigation by weakening the Bazaar survivors. After this conversation, you’ll complete The Raid story quest and begin the journey to make the Dying Light 2 Water Tower choice to advance the story and the faction war within Old Villedor. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:whitesmoke">And like last time, below is a YouTube video of what it looks like: </h2>
<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nCq97qSCgtU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h1 style="color:white">And now the mission with the 2nd major story decision: Water Tower </h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now after we defuse the bombs and climb the tower, We are faced with a decision while talking to the bandits Jack and Joe <del style="color:#373e42">mama</del>.  </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">We are now faced to negotiate or fight. This is not a major choice, Whatever we pick we will confirm the decision later.</h2>
<br>
<image  src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxMib4e7kquJRDUbzi9kDM-970-80.jpg.webp"></image>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now whatever you pick we will get the major choice decision after this, whether you wanna fight or not.</h2>
<br>
<image src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TxUommwMPCdFuQuQASyhLL-970-80.jpg.webp"></image>
<br>
 <h2 style="color:white">Now picking to fight will obviously initiate a boss fight with the two. If you tell them to get out of town they leave and show up at a later point in the game with a side quest (optional, but it's there if you want it).</h2>
 <br>
 <h2 style="color:white">As usual, I am gonna link a video of both choices in action.</h2> 
 <br>
 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xj1Vj-ymoCQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <br>
 <h1 style="color:white"> Now comes the real shit. After we finished what we did. We either choose to give the water tower to the <text style="color:rgb(66, 141, 211)">Peacekeepers</text>  or to the survivors. </h1>
<h2 style="color:white">Now this is where the game starts to come in with the power of decision making. If you give it to the Survivors, you will fuck over the peacekeepers, And vice versa for peacekeepers.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">This will have some long term story effects whether we choose to give it to the <text style="color:#428dd3">Peacekeepers</text> or survivors.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">This choice of who you assign the water tower to also determines which of the next two story quests you play once this one is completed: Revolution if you assign it to the Survivors, or Into the Dark if you assign it to the Peacekeepers. These are both totally unique missions, but once they are done you return to the linear story path for the moment.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">After assigning the water tower Hakon will call, and Aiden relays the information to him about Lucas. Hakon suggests you go search Barney’s hideout at the Tango Motel for any clues.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> Now you might be thinking this part is not important, but now we will notice the story effects in action.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> There will be a boss fight when we go to the tango motel to look for some evidence that hakon told us about, Now if we had given the water tower to the Survivors. Afer the barney boss fight, Either <text style="color:#428dd3">Aitor</text> will come and arrest Barney, Or Sophie will come and try to convince us the survivors weren't the ones responsible for Lucas' death. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> Now, After that, If barney got detained by the <text style="color:#428dd3">Peacekeepers</text>, Aitor would now tell us to go to the metro station to go to the central loop. As he promised.  </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now, As we are heading to the central loop, the power would cut out because of a bombing initiated by the survivors against the <text style=color:#428dd3>Peacekeepers </text> as part of their plan to kill the power. </h2>
<h2 style="color:white">Now below is a preview of either decisions and their outcomes for the story whether barney got detained or not.</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SzGnTcSRfAM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now, After this whole shit happened, Hakon will call us telling us to meet at Sarah and Jana's place.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white" >After going into the hut to meet Hakon, he will try to exit the door but get shot by a crossbow bolt. Now this next choice will have alot of major impact on the story later on. He admits to working with waltz and we see the wound from the lazarus implicating he killed <text style="color:#428dd3">Lucas</text>. </h2>
<br>
<hr>
<h2 style="color:white">Now. After that, we can either choose to leave Hakon to die or save him. Better pick the decision wisely because it will have ALOT of impact. </h2>
<image src="https://www.spieltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dying-light2-hakon-1-1024x576.png"></image>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now, If we left hakon we would just obviously leave him there to rot, But if we decided to save him, we would pull the crossbow bolt out of his chest and go find the person that shot Hakon. </h2>
<h2 style="color:white">  </h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pDkjnsloO0U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now, I will leave it like this and continue to broadcast because you will understand what happens later. </h2>
<br>
<hr>
<h2 style="color:white">So now we are at "Welcome on Board," In this mission, you go to the <text style="color:#428dd3">Peacekeeper</text>floating fortress to meet Jack Matt and learn more about their fight to take back the VNC tower, and you'll also be introduced to Juan after being told to look for him to find the status of the UV lamps.  Juan becomes convinced you shouldn't trust the Peacekeeper leader, and asks for you to ally yourself with him instead. </h2>
<br>
<image height="500" width="900" src="https://www.upcomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dyinglightgame_x64_rwdi.exe-Screenshot-2022.02.06-01.31.40.44.jpg"></image>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">In actuality, you'll still follow through with Jack Matt's plan either way, but this will now open up the possibility to dig up dirt on Jack Matt's past and possibly oust him as leader of the Peacekeepers, should you continue to indulge Juan's quests - starting with a new quest he gives you - The Cathedral - to bug the transmitter to place on the VNC tower.</h2>
<br> 
<h2 style="color:white">If you side with Jack Matt, Juan's role in the story will be over, and you'll later only be able to choose between Frank and Jack Matt when deciding what to do with the tower</h2>
<br>
<hr>
<h2 style="color:white">And now after all of that was done, we are now heading into Broadcast. The mission where we also unlock the grappling hook, but that dosent matter. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now, We are presented to climb the VNC tower. After we climb it. We are faced with 2 choices.. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> Now, if we had sided with <text style="color:#428dd3" >Jack Matt</text>, We would get the option to either give it to him or to Frank. But if we sided with Juan, We would get the option to give it to Juan or frank. </h2>
<br>
<image src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpQPihV3UKkLiMVeGFHWyW-970-80.jpg.webp"></image>
<h2 style="color:white">Giving the transmitter to Jack Matt has the immediate effect of giving total control of the radio to the Peacekeepers, causing propaganda to be blasted out across the city. Later on, you’ll have to help Jack with boosting the signal by activating extra antennas, which will eventually lead to you locating a key character for later in the story.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If we sided with Juan, we would allow Juan to gain control of the radio transmitter which means you will actually give it to the Peacekeepers and Jack Matt, but you will also plant Juan’s bug, allowing him to spy on them. In the cutscene after you make this choice, you’ll see the Peacekeepers using the radio to spout some propaganda and will then see Juan looking very pleased with himself.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you let Juan listen in to the transmitter, it will soon start a new quest, Spy Game, as you learn about the secrets Jack Matt is hiding regarding his involvement in the chemical bombing, and you'll track the shipment of UV lamps that didn't go to the VNC tower. This will also eventually unlock an optional side quest to find more dirt on Jack Matt, leading to a confrontation with Hakon.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now what if we had given it to frank?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Following through on Frank’s request will give control of the radio transmitter to the Survivors, thus allowing Frank to establish New Hope Radio.
 Soon after, you’ll be tasked with boosting the signal by activating more antennas which will also lead you to locating a key character for later in the story.</h2>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Depending on who you gave the VNC Tower access to you, several paths may take you to a large church in Renegade territory. This can either come from Frank during the Nightrunners quest, or Juan will give you a side quest to find an informant, making this encounter actually optional. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now, we will be given some major decisions here that will decide the fate of a key character later in the story. We can either choose to fight Hakon or to refuse fighting him. </h2>
<br>
<image src="https://www.ggrecon.com/media/u5khmwdc/dying-light-2-save-hakon-or-let-him-die-1.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb1%2Frs%3Adevice%2Frscb1-1&format=webp&mode=crop&quality=80&width=682"></image>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now, here is where the good part comes in. If we had chose to save Hakon earlier when he got shot, talking him down would actually make him calm down and resulting in more major decisions, but if we had left him, talking him down would do nothing and we would have to fight him to the death.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now, if we had talked him down successfully, we would have a cutscene and then Lawan would come in and try to kill him, we have a choice to talk her out of it or not. Talking her out of it will of course make her not kill Hakon. If we choose to let Lawan kill him, then she will shoot him with a bolt on the chest and then watch him suffer.</h2>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now after that mess, we are going to talk about the mission called "The Breakthrough".</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you sided with the Survivors and gave Frank access to the VNC Tower transmitter during The Broadcast mission, he'll be able to to help evacuate people once the missiles are first launched at the end of the Veronika mission. This can spare him a mortal wound, but Frank's fate is still in your hands.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">During the Survivor main story mission, The Breakthrough, Frank will broker a meeting between himself, Jack Matt of the Peacekeepers, and Colonel Williams of the Renegades, but a truck will ambush you and shoot Frank with a poison arrow. You'll have only seconds to decide to what to do next:</h2>
<h2 style="color:white"> We can leave Frank and go chase after the truck and trust <text style="color:#428dd3">Jack Matt </text>to help him. Or we can try to help Frank. </h2>
<br>

<image height="450" width="790" src="https://attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dying-Light-2-Help-Frank.jpg"></image>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you choose to go after the truck, a timed chase around the city will start, where you'll have to follow the truck until it to a Renegades Hideout. However, Jack will radio Aiden to inform him that Frank <text style="color:#c91313">died. </text></h2>
<h2 style="color:white">If you choose to help Frank, Juan will suggest that Margaret, the healer, might be able to help (this will only happen if she's still alive in your game). Aiden will take the arrow to Margaret; she'll tell him to look for some herbs that grow underwater, and after getting them, Aiden will deliver them to Lawan and save Frank. She'll stay with him instead of running off to the Stronghold to try and kill Williams herself.</h2>
<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQfDT5f-sAQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now comes the real shit, after what happened earlier, Steve is now driving us to the stronghold.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Here in this mission "Now or Never" we will decide the fate of The Colonel. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">The mission to breach the Stronghold and find "The Butcher" Colonel Williams can play out in a few different ways depending on your choices thus far. Mainly, things will depend on if Lawan goes after Williams or not.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If Frank died (either you sided with Juan or opted to chase the truck instead of sticking around with Frank), Lawan will blame his death on the Colonel and race ahead to try and kill him herself. This actually helps your infiltration, as she'll wipe out every Renegade on the way there. If not, you'll have to fight your way in to find Williams yourself. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">For the first option, you can finally reach Williams who is already trying to deal with Lawan - who has his wife at crossbow-point:</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> Now we are faced with 2 choices here that can decide his fate: We can side with Lawan, or trust The Colonel. </h2>
<br>
<image src="https://www.ggrecon.com/media/xmwewfrw/dl2-the-colonel-2.jpg?mode=crop&width=682&quality=80&format=webp&ezimgfmt=rs:388x218/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1"></image>
<h2 style="color:white">If you choose to trust The Colonel, Lawan will reluctantly lower her weapon, and The Colonel's men will take her to the infirmary. The Colonel will show you Waltz's quarters and arrange transportation so you can go to X13.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you choose to side with Lawan, she will shoot The Colonel's wife by mistake, the guards will attack, and she'll get injured. You'll have to fight them as well as The Colonel's Champion. Aiden will let Jack men's in, and you'll have to search for The Colonel in a new area of the map that's filled with exploding infected. Depending on your choices, The Colonel might kill himself or stay alive. Should he stay alive, he'll feature in the epilogue, and may jointly rule what's left of the city with others.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you take on the Colonel without Lawan, you may just have Jack Matt on your side - but the truth of the matter is Matt was behind the attack on Frank, and wants to silence the Colonel because they both know Williams didn't order the chemical strike on the city during the fall - but Jack Matt knew about the impending strike and did nothing.
    You'll talk with The Colonel here. He'll tell you that he isn't working with Waltz and will be surprised that Frank isn't there. Aiden will tell him what happened, but The Colonel insists he wasn't responsible for Frank's attack. You'll have to choose between the following:</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Believe The Colonel / Believe <text style="color:#428dd3"> Jack Matt</text> </h2>
<br>
    <image src="https://guides.gamepressure.com/dying-light-2/gfx/word/360239296.jpg"></image>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you choose to believe The Colonel, Matt will swear to kill you, and his Peacekeepers will try to ambush you on route to X13 - However, if Frank survived, the Nightrunners will assist you and stop the fight. The Colonel will show you Waltz's quarters and arrange transport so Aiden can go to X13. If you side with Jack Matt, Williams will die, and the truth will be swept under the rug.</h2>
<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0ZPHQP_4WQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now after that, we have reached the mission "X13".</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">You will be instructed to find a tunnel leading to X13 and then you will enter the final mission in the game. </h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Now I will just explain what happens during the major choices, since that is what you are here for.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">When you reach the final mission in the game, you'll be forced to confront Waltz to get the GRE Key back, and you'll learn the key is the only way to stop the missiles, but Waltz needs it to keep Mia alive. Unfortunately, confrontation is unavoidable, and in the aftermath, the key is broken.</h2>
<h2 style="color:white">Without a key, the only way to save the city is to attach bombs to the missiles, so they blow up before reaching the city. The problem is that the bombs need to be triggered manually, so whoever triggers them will die. TO make matters worse, if the bombs are detonated, X13 will go down with it, as will Mia's chance of survival.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white"> Now we have 2 choices to make during this. We can either:</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">Let Lawan detonate the bombs / Save lawan </h2>
<br>
<image height="500" width="880" src="https://attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dying-Light-2-Let-Lawan-Detonate-the-Bombs.jpg"></image>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you choose to save Lawan, Aiden will try to stop her so she can't detonate the bombs. You'll have a few minutes to follow the yellow marker and get to Lawan's position. Once you get there, Aiden will start turning and almost kills Lawan, but he'll manage to get her out seconds before the missiles launch. Half the population of the city will die, but Lawan will live. Mia's fate is unknown, and Aiden will soon leave the city, letting whoever else survived vie for control in his absence.</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If Hakon is still alive, he will come in and take care of Mia while Aiden goes for Lawan. Afterward, he will be the one who joins Aiden when he decides to get out of the city.</h2>
<br>
<hr>    
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">If you let Lawan detonate the bombs, she'll sacrifice herself as Aiden will get out of the facility with Mia, and X13 will blow up. The city will survive, but Lawan will die. Without X13, Mia will die shortly thereafter, and Aiden will leave the city.
</h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white">However, if Hakon is still alive, he will rescue Lawan at the last second, and both the city and Lawan will be saved. Mia will die a couple of hours later, and Aiden will leave the city with Lawan by his side - if Frank survived as well.</h2>
